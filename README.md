Try the [Demo](https://react-mapbox-playground.vercel.app/) !

- A simple test on integrating map directions with api retries
- Works on both desktop and mobile devices!

Time spent coding: **~3 days**
## üëÅÔ∏è Instruction

- You will get different responses from the backend everytime you try to get route.
- DO NOT WORRY if you get `Internal Server Error`, this app is made to test api retries and show different user interfaces depending on the response status.

### Reminder
- Currently it is connected to a mock server to provide the `waypoints`, therefore we will always get the same waypoints no matter our destination
- However, the route service is connected to the actual `mapbox` directions api, so if we change the mock server to return other array of paths/waypoints, it will show accordingly
